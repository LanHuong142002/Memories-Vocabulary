# REACT TRAINING PLAN

- Here is my documents about [React Training Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13sGZCv0PRcueEevHrwADEoxyWuGxiBNUE1Uq7PyQdSk/edit#heading=h.t04yplj7qvu4)

## OVERVIEW

A revision of React training plan which focuses on the latest version of React (v17.0.2). It will help trainees learn React fundamentals step by step following the instructions and hands-on practices.

### TIMELINE

- Main Concepts and Hooks: 2 weeks
  - At the end of this step, trainees should be able to join projects for hot training and doing React Components.
- Advanced Guides: 2 weeks

## PREREQUISITE

Supporters should make sure trainees got below prerequisites

- [ES6](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/es6/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html)
- Install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v16.x
- Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) v6.x

## GETTING STARTED

### BUILD TOOL

We use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) which is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.

### HELLO WORLD

If you have pnpm installed already, let's start your first project using pnpm and vite. You can either choose template as react, or react-ts if you want to init with TypeScript. From your terminal, run

```
pnpm create vite my-react-app -- --template react-ts
```

Install and run on local

```
cd my-react-app
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open your browser at http://localhost:3000

Try modifying your React component and see how it changes.

If you are using VS Code and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), make sure you installed extension [Remote - WSL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl)

Start reading [Hello World](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) documentation.

## MAIN CONCEPTS

Step by step learning the main concepts. For any examples you found in the documentation, you can try it in your first React app created above.

While reading Main Concepts, you can also do [hands-on practice](https://gitlab.asoft-python.com/bgh/javascript/react/-/wikis/home#practice) at the same time.

- [Composition vs Inheritance](https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html)
- [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)

### STORYBOOK

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is an open source tool for building UI components and pages in isolation. It streamlines UI development, testing and documentation.

Init storybook into your first React app:

```
# init storybook
pnpx sb init -s
# install dependencies
pnpm install
# run it
pnpm storybook
```

Try to create a Storybook for your example components. https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/intro-to-storybook/react/en/simple-component/

#### PRACTICE

Apply what you have read to rewrite your previous HTML/CSS practice into React components.

Apply Storybook into your practice.

### REACT HOOKS

Hooks let you use state and other React features without writing a class.

- [Introducing Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
- [Hooks at a Glance](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html)
- [useState Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html)
- [useEffect Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html)
- [useContext Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecontext)
- [useRef Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useref)
- [Rules of Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html)
- [Hooks API Reference](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html)

#### DEBUGGING

- Debug tools: [React DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi). Supporters have to present how this tool works.
- Install the extension and use it to debug your practices.

#### PRACTICE

This practice will let you understand about simple flow in React:

- Using React hooks
- Filter and editing list of products
  - Create mocking data: write a JSON file and import it into your JSX
  - User filters by column values
  - User edits/deletes product item

At the end of this step, trainees should be able to join projects for hot training and doing React Components.

### ADVANCED GUIDES

All the topics in the [Advanced Guides](https://reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html#:~:text=MAIN%20CONCEPTS-,ADVANCED%20GUIDES,-Accessibility) need to be read. Some highlight topics need more focus:

  - [Auto Revalidation](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/revalidation)
  - [Pagination](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/pagination)

#### UNIT TESTING

Supporters should give a brief introduction for unit testing and how to set it up.

- [Testing Recipes](https://reactjs.org/docs/testing-recipes.html)
- [Testing environments](https://reactjs.org/docs/testing-environments.html)

#### PRACTICE

- Features:

  - User adds & deletes a product
  - User deletes a product
  - User opens the product detail page
  - User edits product information on the product detail page
  - Product data will be kept when refreshing the page

- Targets:
  - Apply useContext, useReducer for state management
  - Apply error boundary
  - Apply SWR for fetching data - from a simple json-server
  - Unit test coverage should be greater than 80%
